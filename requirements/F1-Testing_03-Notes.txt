https://www.amazon.com/s?i=videogames-intl-ship&rh=n%3A%2116225016011&page=3

all of these links resulted in: " Request failed. The link might be wrong, or there is no internet connection "

-------------------------------------------------------------------

If I added the XPath 'ReleaseDate' : '//div[3]/div[2]/div[1]/div/div[2]/div[1]/div[2]',
it results in:
"
File "main_01.py", line 204, in <module>
    a_row[attribute], number_of_regex_found_locally = lib.regex_string(data_found_dict[attribute][i], regex_instance_list)
IndexError: list index out of range
"

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Also if I added this URL to the middle of URLS.txt:
https://www.hrkgame.com/en/randomkeyshop/buy/
it results in the same error then stops without generating output.csv , ( can it continue to the remaining URLs in case of an error like this occurs? )
"
File "main_01.py", line 204, in <module>
    a_row[attribute], number_of_regex_found_locally = lib.regex_string(data_found_dict[attribute][i], regex_instance_list)
IndexError: list index out of range
