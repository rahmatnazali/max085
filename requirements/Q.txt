1. You mentioned earlier in Feature 1 "Unit Testing", but I didn't quite understand what is it for exactly?

2. I've seen that Scrapy Splash is also works for scraping JS pages, do you know how it differs from selenuim in terms of speed, performence or reliability?

3. Can these features (1 & 2) be converted to a Web App? where config is entered into a web form and the software ran on a server?

4. Can I utilize concurrency and multithreading when running the softwars to decrease the runtime? (for example: scraping 10 URLs at once)

5. Do you have experince in the following fields:
* Django/Flask
* PHP
* HTML/CSS/JS
* Python Qt5 GUI
* Python HTML/JS GUI (for example: https://github.com/manatlan/wuy , https://github.com/Andrew-Shay/Neuron , https://github.com/ChrisKnott/Eel)
